# End to end project

This is an end to end project to predict students performace in maths by considering different features. The different features include both numerical data and categorical data. And different preporcessing steps like Onehot Encoding, Standardization techniques have been used to transfortm data and this is then used to train different Machine Learning models to find the best one. 
The project structure is replicating the structure implemented in the industries. 
And this was sort of a tutorial for me as it was my first attempt to implement an end-to-end project in this structure.
